# SQL_Challenge

In this challenge, there were two sections: Data Engineering and Data Analysis. This was surprisingly easy to complete, especially after using the code from the creation of the ERD to create the tables and insert the data via CSV files.

## Data Engineering
I used the code created from the ERD, as previously mentioned, to create the table schema. I also have the image of the ERD, as required.

## Data Analysis
A majority of this part was a breeze. The only one I remember struggling on was the "Hercules B". I just couldn't get that right, so I turned to Overstack Flow. I don't remember how many questions I searched until I found something that I understood and could use to help me with the query. Overall, I believe that my work is quite good and did not mind doing this challenge at all.
